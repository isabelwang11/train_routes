# train_routes
Exploration of the Dijkstra and A* search algorithms (on top of traditional BFS and DFS style searches) on a map of the train routes in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. train_routes_animation.py implements an interactive animation of each algorithm using Tkinter. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3ClMAJ42J4&ab_channel=IsabelWang for a demo.
